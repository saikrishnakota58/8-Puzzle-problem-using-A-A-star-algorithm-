The goal of this project is to code a solution to the N-puzzle problem by applying the A* search algorithm.
The puzzle consists of N tiles and one empty space where the tiles can be moved. Start and Goal configurations (also called state) of the puzzle are provided. The puzzle can be solved by moving the tiles one by one in the single empty space and thus achieving the Goal configuration.
