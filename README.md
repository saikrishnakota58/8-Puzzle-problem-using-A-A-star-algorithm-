The goal of this project is to code a solution to the N-puzzle problem by applying the A* search algorithm.
The puzzle consists of N tiles and one blank space where the tiles can be moved. Start and Goal  stateof the puzzle are provided. The puzzle can be solved by moving the tiles  in the single blank space and thus achieving the Goal state.
The empty space can only move in four directions viz.,
